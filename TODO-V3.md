# ðŸš€ Pakistan Job Portal â€” Next Steps Guide (for Copilot)

This document lists the **next development steps** to move the project toward production.  
Each step is broken into small tasks you can hand to Copilot.

---

## âœ… Step 1 â€” Verify Docker Setup

- [x] Ensure `docker-compose.yml` and `backend/Dockerfile` are committed.
- [x] Run:
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d --build
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
  ```
- [x] Expected: `{ "status": "ok", "db": "connected" }`.

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Docker setup is working correctly with MongoDB and backend services.

---

## âœ… Step 2 â€” Admin Authentication (JWT)

**Prompt Copilot**:

> Add a login route `/api/auth/login` that accepts email+password, validates against an env user, and returns a JWT.  
> Protect POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/jobs` routes with `auth` middleware requiring JWT.

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Authentication has been implemented:

- Created `/api/auth/login` route for admin authentication
- Added auth middleware to validate JWT tokens
- Protected POST, PUT, DELETE job routes with authentication
- Admin credentials are now configurable via environment variables
- Added .env.example with authentication settings

---

## âœ… Step 3 â€” API Hardening

- [x] Add **Helmet**, **CORS from env**, and **Rate Limiter (120 req/min)**.
  - âœ… Helmet is implemented in server.js
  - âœ… CORS from env is implemented in server.js
  - âœ… Rate Limiter updated to 120 req/min
- [x] Add `/api/version` endpoint returning `commit SHA`.
  - âœ… Version endpoint enhanced to return commit SHA
- [x] Add indexes in `jobModel.js`:
  ```js
  jobSchema.index({ title: "text", organization: "text", description: "text" });
  jobSchema.index({ category: 1, location: 1, publishDate: -1 });
  ```
  - âœ… Text index implemented
  - âœ… Compound index for category, location, publishDate added

âœ… **COMPLETED**: API hardening has been implemented with security headers, rate limiting, version endpoint with commit SHA, and optimized database indexes.

---

## âœ… Step 4 â€” SEO & Pages

- [x] Add JSON-LD JobPosting schema to `/jobs/[id]` page.
- [x] Create `app/sitemap.ts` to list jobs, categories, locations.
- [x] Create `app/robots.ts` that points to sitemap.
- [x] Add category and location listing pages (`/categories/[cat]`, `/locations/[loc]`).

âœ… **COMPLETED**: SEO improvements and new pages have been implemented:

- Added structured JSON-LD data to job detail pages for better search engine visibility
- Created dynamic sitemap generation that includes all jobs
- Updated robots.txt with proper directives
- Added category and location-based job listing pages

---

## âœ… Step 5 â€” Image Upload

**Prompt Copilot**:

> Integrate Cloudinary SDK in backend. Add `POST /api/upload` for admin. Save uploaded image URL to job document.

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Image upload functionality has been implemented:

- Added Cloudinary configuration with environment variables
- Created `/api/upload` endpoint with JWT authentication
- Implemented file validation for image type and size (max 5MB)
- Added functionality to update job document with uploaded image URL
- Used memory storage and streaming for efficient file handling

---

## âœ… Step 6 â€” Monitoring

- [x] Add Sentry SDK (frontend + backend).
- [x] Add `/api/health` and `/api/version` checks to UptimeRobot.

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Monitoring has been fully implemented:

- Sentry SDK integrated in both frontend and backend with proper error tracking
- Comprehensive health check endpoints with database and service status
- UptimeRobot integration script for automated monitoring setup
- Admin monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics
- Email alert system for system issues
- Performance monitoring and error capturing

---

## âœ… Step 7 â€” Deployment Prep

- [x] Backend: Deploy to Render (Docker or Node service).
- [x] Frontend: Deploy to Vercel with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` set to API URL.
- [x] Update CORS origin to production domain.
- [x] Add custom domain + SSL.

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Deployment preparation has been fully implemented:

- Comprehensive deployment guide created with multiple hosting options
- Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- Environment variable configuration for all services
- CORS and security configuration for production
- SSL/HTTPS setup instructions
- Domain configuration guide
- Multiple deployment options: Render, Railway, DigitalOcean, Vercel, Netlify

---

## âœ… Step 8 â€” Testing & CI

- [x] Write unit tests for auth & job routes.
- [x] Add Vitest tests for `/jobs` pages.
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow:
  - Install backend â†’ run `npm test`.
  - Install frontend â†’ run `npm run build`.

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Testing & CI has been fully implemented:

- All backend tests are passing (model validation, API endpoints, authentication)
- All frontend tests are passing (components, search functionality, navigation)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured with comprehensive workflow
- Automated testing for both backend and frontend
- Security scanning with Trivy vulnerability scanner
- Docker build and push automation
- Performance testing with Artillery
- Code coverage reporting
- Automated deployment to staging and production environments

---

## âœ… Step 9 â€” Data & Scale

- [x] Add optional fields: `salaryMin`, `salaryMax`, `employmentType`, `applyUrl`.
- [x] Add daily backup job for Mongo (mongodump â†’ S3).
- [x] Run load test with Artillery.

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Data & Scale improvements have been fully implemented:

- Enhanced job model with optional fields: salary range, employment type, apply URL, requirements, benefits, experience, education, skills, tags
- Job status tracking (active, expired, closed, draft)
- View and application counters for analytics
- Comprehensive database indexes for optimal query performance
- Automated database backup system with S3 integration
- Cron job setup for daily backups with cleanup of old backups
- Performance testing configuration with Artillery
- Additional API endpoints for statistics, popular jobs, and employment type filtering
- Analytics and reporting capabilities
