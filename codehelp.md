curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Job","company":"Test Company"}'

# Test protected endpoint with token (should succeed)
TOKEN="your_jwt_token"
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

Show diffs and curl commands to test.
```

**Testing Commands:**

```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..130}; do

- Allow all bots, disallow /admin and /api, point to sitemap.

Add category and location listing pages:
- frontend/app/categories/[category]/page.tsx
- frontend/app/locations/[location]/page.tsx
Each fetches from API with filters and renders a list.

- Upload to Cloudinary folder from env.CLOUDINARY_FOLDER
- If jobId provided, update job.imageUrl

Update backend/server.js to use /api/upload.
Update backend/models/jobModel.js to ensure imageUrl exists.

Show diffs and curl command to test upload with Bearer token.
```

**Testing Commands:**

```bash
# Get an authentication token first
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@jobportal.com","password":"admin123"}' \
  | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*"' | awk -F':' '{print $2}' | tr -d '\"')

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@/path/to/your/test-image.jpg"

# Upload an image and associate with a job
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@/path/to/your/test-image.jpg" \
  -F "jobId=your_job_id_here"
```
